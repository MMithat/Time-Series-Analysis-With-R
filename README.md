# Time Series Analysis for Infaltion Data
 I performed a statistical analysis on the inflation data obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I conducted time series analyses and created plots to explore the patterns in the data. Additionally, I applied anomaly detection techniques to filter out unusual observations and performed a 12-month forecasting on the cleansed dataset.
